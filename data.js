    "about": "Hi, I'm Aditya. I’m a developer who thrives on solving problems and exploring possibilities. Whenever something doesn’t work, I don’t stop — I experiment, rethink, and find new angles until a solution fits. I believe every challenge has multiple routes, and I enjoy figuring out the most efficient and cost-effective one. I value practicality over perfection — building systems that are reliable, maintainable, and scalable with available resources. Whether it’s debugging a tricky backend issue or designing a new workflow, I focus on understanding how and why something works rather than just making it work. I approach development with persistence, curiosity, and a constant drive to learn. My goal is to keep growing through real-world projects, build smarter solutions, and never lose the habit of questioning 'what if this could be done better?'",
